-- MAGIC # Failed Login Detection Rule (System Tables)
-- MAGIC
-- MAGIC **Rule ID**: AUTH-001  
-- MAGIC **Author**: Security Team  
-- MAGIC **Version**: 2.0.0  
-- MAGIC
-- MAGIC ## Overview
-- MAGIC This detection rule identifies multiple failed login attempts from the same source IP or targeting the same user account within a specified time window using Databricks system tables.
-- MAGIC
-- MAGIC ## Detection Logic
-- MAGIC - Monitors system.access.audit for authentication events
-- MAGIC - Groups by source IP and target user
-- MAGIC - Triggers when threshold exceeded within time window
-- MAGIC
-- MAGIC ## Data Sources
-- MAGIC - system.access.audit
