-- MAGIC # Failed Login Detection Rule (System Tables)
-- MAGIC 
-- MAGIC **Rule ID**: AUTH-001  
-- MAGIC **Author**: Security Team  
-- MAGIC **Version**: 2.0.0  
-- MAGIC **Last Updated**: 2024-01-15  
-- MAGIC 
-- MAGIC ## Overview
-- MAGIC This detection rule identifies potential brute force attacks by monitoring for multiple failed login attempts from the same source IP or targeting the same user account within a specified time window using Databricks system tables.
-- MAGIC 
-- MAGIC ## Detection Logic
-- MAGIC - Monitors system.access.audit for authentication events
-- MAGIC - Groups by source IP and target user
-- MAGIC - Triggers when threshold exceeded within time window
-- MAGIC - Correlates with user behavior baselines
-- MAGIC - Uses system.query.history for additional context
-- MAGIC 
-- MAGIC ## MITRE ATT&CK Mapping
-- MAGIC - **Tactic**: TA0006 (Credential Access)
-- MAGIC - **Technique**: T1110 (Brute Force)
-- MAGIC 
-- MAGIC ## Data Sources
-- MAGIC - system.access.audit (Primary)
-- MAGIC - system.query.history (Context)
